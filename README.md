## Introduce

[__FURB__](https://furb.br), is a University located in the south of Brazil, the Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, which I attended and had the opportunity to study the Computer Graphics class with Professor __Dalton Reis__, he is an expert in Multimedia, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, etc. And he is very patient with the students; take a look at his [web site](http://www.inf.furb.br/~dalton/dalton/Home.html).

I attended Computer Graphics classes with my ex-colleagues __Eduardo__ and __Rafael__, we formed a group and together we developed this version of the Pac-Man game.

The game is not much different from the original version, but it only has a single stage and a single map.

## Development Tools

To develop the game, we use:
- IDE NetBeans.
- Library  OpenGL (jogl - Java OpenGL)
- Library  Gluegen-rt

The .jar files of the mentioned libraries are located at the root of the folder project but you can look at the respective MAVEM repositories or download directly from the source:

        <artifactId>jogl-all-main</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.2</version>
    </dependency>

        <version>2.3.2</version>
    </dependency>

## Run It

You can download the project, open it in NetBeans or in your preferred IDE (make the necessary adjustments, if necessary) and run the game directly from the IDE, you can also generate the definitive .jar if you want.
